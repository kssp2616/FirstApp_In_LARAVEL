<h5> DO YOU HAVE SIZING INFORMATION? </h5>
<p>We try to include as much accurate sizing information for each product as possible. We have also added a size charts link to every product in the product detail page. Reference the size charts to help determine your size when ordering. Because sizing and cut will vary between brands, please use this chart as a general guide to compare the various size scales. If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact using the in-store messenger.</p>

<h5> RETURNS POLICY? </h5>
<p>You have 14 days once you have received the parcel to initiate a refund to receive a full cash refund. However once that time period has passed we initiate a processing fee. This is so we keep in line with the consumer rights act 2015. As an independent clothing company, this processing fee is 50% the original order total - which will be deducted from your total refund. </p>

<p>The cost of returning the item is covered by the customer unless for any unforeseen circumstances, where the product is faulty then the cost of shipping is covered for you by us.</p>

If we have not heard back from you within those 10 days we will have to restock your items due to not being able to keep hold of orders for a long period of time.
